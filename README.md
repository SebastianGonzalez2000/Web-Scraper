# Web-Scraper
Application that periodically scrapes a Job listing web page, filters the jobs according to the users skills, and records the relevant data to a file that the user can later check. This attempts to simplify and automize the job searching process.

### What I learned:

 - The structure of HTML requests and responses
 - String manipulation and analysis
